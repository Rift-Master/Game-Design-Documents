Game Concepts

Fish in a barrel. A joke mini-game created over a few days. It started out as an original fishing game with the twist that players then threw
the fish up in the air after they reel it in and shoot it several times with a pistol to cook it.
The amount of accurate shots made in a short period of time determined how well the fish was reviewed on "Finstagram" from 1 to 5 stars

Punch Em Up - Another vertical slice created to help teach and practice fighting game inputs on a game pad. The player takes control of an
old bouncer who constantly punches from light to medium to heavy attacks on the game pad 

Kid Combo - A pet project of a single screen new age beat em up. Play as the God of Animated Violence returning from the dead to kill the rest of his.
The main mechanics of this game were creating a character who's fought more effectively if the light and heavy attacks were entered in a rhthym
(to help disuade needless button mashing) as well as hit enemies around the screen in impeccable combos that.
The game was created with both controller and smartphones in mind.
The player would also be able to use super attacks that chnage the background of the environment (such as a shark attack devouring all enemies on 
the left side of the screen.

The theme of the game was on television genres (Sports, Musical, Animal Channel, History Channel, Silent Movies, Cooking Shows, Commercials) and the (with the final boss being the News)
