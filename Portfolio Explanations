Game Concepts

Fish in a barrel. 
A joke mini-game created over a few days as a combination of programming a fun fishing minigame and a shooting gallery game.
The player starts out thinking they are playing your average fishing game where they really the fish in while staying cautious of the tension in the fishing line.
The twist however is when the player is about to get the fish out the water, the character throws the fish up and shoot it several times with a special revolver that cooks 
the fish as it gets shot with little targets appearing all over it's body.
The amount of accurate shots made in the shortest period of time determined how well the fish was reviewed on "Finstagram" from 1 to 5 stars.

Development was fun espectially for using more complex math equations to get the perfect fishing line angle using more complex math equations in C# that I was typically used to with real time line renderers.

Punch Em Up - Another vertical slice created to help teach and practice fighting game inputs on a game pad. The player takes control of an
old bouncer who constantly punches from light to medium to heavy attacks on the game pad. To break through a ceiling you would have to input a Shoryuken command and if wanted to active a switch you would have to bounce the
character off the button with a Hadouken command.
The dash would be performed with a Tatsumaki motion.
The story while not a very important aspect of the game saw a hired strong arm beating a man who was possessed by a building through several different stories of a building in an antempt to purge the demon as 
hell itself was muscling into the territory of a local crime family.

Kid Combo - A pet project of a single screen new age beat em up. Play as the God of Animated Violence returning from the dead to kill the rest of his.
The main mechanics of this game were creating a character who's fought more effectively if the light and heavy attacks were entered in a rhthym
(to help disuade needless button mashing) as well as hit enemies around the screen in impeccable co mbos that.
The game was created with both controller and smartphones in mind.
The player would also be able to use super attacks that chnage the background of the environment (such as a shark attack devouring all enemies on 
the left side of the screen.

The Appeal of the game- The Appeal of the Game was the Aesthetic. A Hyper Actively Nostalgic Action based on American and Japanese Cartoons from across generations but mostly focussed on the loud and proud nature of 90s
counter culture. Extreme Expressions, Scratchy Music, over use of gore and gags. Overstimulating for the uninitiated but hitting every dopamine center imaginable for those who so crave it like a sugar high from a banned
soda.

The theme of the game was on television genres (Sports, Musical, Animal Channel, History Channel, Sitcoms, Silent Movies, Cooking Shows, Commercials, Educational Television) and the (with the final boss being the News)

A Dungeon Crawler Boardgame where players took the role of superheroes. They could customize their own powers and abilities and even the layout of the board as each piece was a comic book panel that they would have to navigate
